# Mining on Crime Data and Suggestions to the Police  
## The Data Mining Goal  
The crime issue, especially violent crimes such as robbery, rape and murder, is one of the biggest problems in the United States. According to the statement of related research, “Even though the violent crime rate has been decreasing since 1990, the United States tops the ranking of countries with the most prisoners”[1]. These kinds of issues not only cause negative impacts on people’s safety and happiness in their lives, but create severe challenges to the government and police department as well. To deal with this issue is never an easy task, as the violent crime rate can be influenced by various factors, from education to income, from family to society, from population density to the police force, etc. Therefore, we want to pick several major factors that may relate to the violent crime rate, and do some analysis and prediction based on their statistical data, and figure out the most influential, or, most crucial in other word, factor(s) of the violent crime rate in the United States. This goal is meaningful, as it can help the government and the police department to figure out and work on the most important direction to continually reduce the violent crime rate, thus creating a safer environment for the people no matter whether they suffer the threat of violent crimes or not.
